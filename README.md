# Type Error in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates a type error encountered in a Next.js 15 application when attempting to add a number and a string.  The error arises from a simple addition operation where one operand is a number and the other is a string.  This issue highlights the importance of type checking and data type consistency in JavaScript, particularly within the context of Next.js applications.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Navigate to `/about`.
6. Observe the resulting error.  The error will likely be a type error.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that both operands are of the same data type before performing the addition operation.  This can be achieved through type conversion.  For example, you could convert the string to a number using `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()`.
